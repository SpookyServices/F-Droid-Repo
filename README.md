### How to use
1. At first, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.
2. Now you can copy the following [link](https://fdroid.spookysrv.com/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=6D519C66F410AA1E94FC3986C608FFCE80409C6970646157994C8DE8C1695EAA), then add this repository to your F-Droid client:

    ```
    https://fdroid.spookysrv.com/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=6D519C66F410AA1E94FC3986C608FFCE80409C6970646157994C8DE8C1695EAA
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also scan this QR code:

    </p>

3. Open the link in F-Droid. It will ask you to add the repository. Everything should already be filled in correctly, so just press "OK".
4. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for "Notality" in the F-Droid client.

Please note that some apps published here might contain [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/). If you can't find an app by searching for it, you can go to settings and enable "Include anti-feature apps".

Apps in this repo may not be open source, but any closed-source/proprietary apps will be labeled as "App itself is not open source" in the anti-features list of the app, along with any anti-features that app may have.
